## This project is dead and has continued as a [Python port](https://github.com/allejok96/jw-scripts) (at last).

Parsing JSON with sed is not a good idea. All kinds of things can break. But I'm still kind of impressed that it worked. If you still want to poke around with the old code, have at it bro!

These scripts lets you download videos from [JW Broadcasting](http://tv.jw.org/) or sound recordings of [publications at JW.ORG](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/). They can create playlists for use in Kodi or on a smartphone, or directory structure for use with Plex. There's also a script for playing one of the [online streams](http://tv.jw.org/#en/live/StreamingOurStudio), and a script for downloading and playing videos offline, like a TV channel.

If you want to see JW Broadcasting in Kodi there's a MUCH better [unofficial add-on](http://ca0abinary.github.io/plugin.video.jwtv-unofficial/).

The download is throttled by default. Use the `--limit-rate` flag to adjust. *But please, somebody think of the servers!* :-)

And as far as legality goes, as of 2017-05-23, the [Terms of Service](http://www.jw.org/en/terms-of-use/) allows:
